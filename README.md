## Contribution Guide

### Special Branches
| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| master | stable branch |
| develop | development branch for **merging** new libraries/features/etc. |


### Branching
Our strategy is simple: 
 1. develop code in a branch
    - test
    - fix
    - test
    - new-feature
 3. merge "" to develop
      - test
      - fix
      - test
      - new-feature
 4. merge develope to master.

As a general guide to naming branches:

| Prefix | Purpose | Delete After? |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `feat-` | feature development | ok |
| `user-patch-` | fixes from github | no |
| `hotfix-` | single commit fixes | no |
| `patch-` | fixes for tracked issues | no |
| `fix-` | other fixes | no |
| `*` | some special branch with an ongoing purpose | no |
